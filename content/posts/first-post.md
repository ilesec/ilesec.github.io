## Introduction
Welcome to my web page! I intend to use this site to post security -related articles.

This site has been set up using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework and [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme. The site is hosted in Github Pages. I initially tried using Github Pages with Jekyll, but I had some issues with some libraries in Windows 11. I then also tried Gatsby JS, but it required running on older Node.JS which I want to avoid.

Hugo framework seems to be simple to set up and I like the high performance and simplicity. There's also a lot of themes available for different use cases.
