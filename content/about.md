I work as a Sr. Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft, focusing on Security. I am passionate about solving problems for customers with technology. My key areas of focus are Cloud Security topics and products such as Defender for Cloud and Sentinel. I love learning about new technology. Recently I have been learning more about software development.

Outside of work, I spend time with my family and do triathlons.
